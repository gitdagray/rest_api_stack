**Description:**

Learn how to build a REST API integrated with MongoDB in this  tutorial. MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database which is an alternative to traditional relational databases. Combining MongoDB with Node and Express JS provide a powerful way to build RESTful services.

[YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/q66NbZB1foU) for this repository.

My [REST API Basics tutorial](https://youtu.be/bC5KVrX-AlA) will help if you are just getting started with REST APIs.

**TO-DOs for Learners:**

Instead of completing all CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations in the tutorial, I walk you through the operations for the quotes route. You should complete the CRUD operations for both authors and categories. I only included the POST (create) operation for those routes. You should complete read all, read one, update, and delete operations for both routes.

**Additional Challenge:**

This tutorial utilized the ME*N stack (MongoDB, Express, *, NodeJS). Fill in the asterisk with your choice for frontend web development and build a client-side application to display the quotes. Provide forms to submit the CRUD operation requests in JSON data type format.
